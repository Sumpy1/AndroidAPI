# AND101 Project 5 - AndroidAPI

Submitted by: **Gopal Pokharel**
Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## Summary

**See a Dog** is an android app that **displays diiferent dog pictures to make your mood happy**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üêïüêæüì±**

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [X] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [X] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [X] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed


The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [X] Added a reset button to see my own dogs

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **https://dog.ceo/dog-api/**.

## Video Demo

Here's a video / GIF that demos all of the app's implemented features:

## Notes

Found out it is a bit more tedious for API with Auth request. So, will work on those apis now.
